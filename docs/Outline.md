#### 28 Introduction to WebGL and GPU rendering **Patrick FÃ¼rst**


* What is computer graphics in general. 
* Why is basically everything on the web computer graphics. 
* What can we do with it and what are the pro and cons. 
* What is Three.js
* What do we learn in this course.
    - CPU vs GPU
    - WebGL/OpenGL render pipeline 
    - Real-time rendering concepts
    - Refresh of Linear Algebra ( vectors, matrices, transformations ) 
    - Three.js 


We start top down, by introducing Three.js and a small example. The concept behind it will be introduced and what the different objects are. The main focus lies on the GPU related things. (materials, shaders, render-pipeline )


After Three.js is introduced the focus is shifted towards the internal workings of Three.js. We will have a look at how it communicates with the GPU, how shaders work, and how the low level WebGL API can be used.

During each step we will have a look at fundamental concepts of real-time rendering and computer graphics. ( render-pipeline, Linear Algebra ) 

By the end we have learned how to create a 3D program that runs in the web browser,while also understanding the basic principles of how computer images are generated.
